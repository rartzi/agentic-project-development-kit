# Development Process for {{project_name}}

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the development process for the {{project_name}} platform. It provides guidelines for how to contribute to the project, including coding standards, testing procedures, and documentation practices.

## 2. Branch Management

We follow a Gitflow branching model:

-   `main`: Production-ready code.
-   `dev`: Integration branch for ongoing development.
-   `feature/*`: Feature branches for new features.
-   `bugfix/*`: Bugfix branches for resolving issues.

### Branching Strategy

1.  Create new branches from `dev`.
2.  Use descriptive branch names: `feature/issue-number-short-description` or `bugfix/issue-number-short-description`.
3.  Make small, focused commits with clear messages.
4.  Reference issue numbers in commit messages.
5.  Create pull requests to merge changes into `dev`.

## 3. Code Standards

Follow these coding standards to ensure code quality and consistency:

-   Use {{language}} with strict mode enabled.
-   Follow the established component hierarchy.
-   Adhere to RESTful API design principles.
-   Write tests for all new functionality.
-   Update documentation for any significant changes.
-   Ensure all UI components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
-   Optimize for performance using established patterns.

## 4. Testing

We use a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure code quality:

-   Unit tests: Test individual components and functions.
-   Integration tests: Test interactions between components.
-   End-to-end tests: Test the entire application flow.

### Testing Guidelines

1.  Write tests for all new functionality.
2.  Run tests before submitting code.
3.  Use a consistent testing framework.
4.  Ensure tests cover all critical code paths.

## 5. Documentation

Keep documentation up-to-date with the latest changes:

-   Update component documentation if you modified or added components.
-   Update API documentation if you modified or added API endpoints.
-   Update data model documentation if you modified the database schema.
-   Update relevant architecture documents to reflect your changes.
-   Ensure diagrams and code examples are up to date.
-   Update development process documentation if you modified workflows.
-   Update project roadmap if you completed milestones or added new ones.

## 6. Pull Request Process

Follow these steps when submitting a pull request:

1.  Create a pull request to merge changes into `dev`.
2.  Include a clear title describing the change.
3.  Provide a description of what was changed and why.
4.  Reference related issues.
5.  Include testing instructions.
6.  Add screenshots or videos for UI changes.
7.  List any breaking changes.

## 7. Code Review Guidelines

-   Ensure code follows coding standards.
-   Check for potential bugs and security vulnerabilities.
-   Verify that tests are comprehensive and cover all critical code paths.
-   Ensure documentation is up-to-date and accurate.
-   Provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.

## 8. Commit Message Guidelines

-   Use clear and concise commit messages.
-   Follow the conventional commits format:
    -   `feat`: New feature
    -   `fix`: Bug fix
    -   `docs`: Documentation changes
    -   `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
    -   `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
    -   `perf`: Performance improvements
    -   `test`: Adding or updating tests
    -   `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
-   Include issue references in commit messages (e.g., "feat(auth): Implement password reset functionality (fixes #123)").
-   Keep commits small and focused on a single change.
