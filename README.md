## Overview

The Agentic Project Development Kit is a comprehensive framework designed to streamline software development processes, enforce best practices, and maximize the effectiveness of AI coding agents. By providing structured templates, documentation guidelines, and process workflows, this kit establishes a standardized environment where both human developers and AI agents can collaborate efficiently while maintaining high-quality standards.

## Key Features

- **Structured Documentation**: Comprehensive templates and guidelines for all aspects of project documentation
- **Process Automation**: Automated workflows for development tasks and documentation updates
- **Compliance Validation**: Real-time checks against established rules and standards
- **Session-Based Workflow**: Guided development sessions with clear start and end processes
- **Technology Agnostic**: Adaptable to various technology stacks and development approaches

## Components

The Solution Creation Kit consists of several interconnected components:

### 1. Documentation Structure

- Architecture Documentation
- Frontend/Backend Documentation
- Project Management Documentation
- Governance & Legal Documentation
- Session & Tracking Documentation

### 2. Development Process Guidelines

- Branch Management
- Code Standards
- Pull Request Process
- Code Review Guidelines
- Commit Message Guidelines

### 3. Session Workflow
